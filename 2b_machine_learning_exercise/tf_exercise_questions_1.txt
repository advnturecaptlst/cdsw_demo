# ## Exercises

# 1. This code trains the model using measurements of
#    pieces from just one brand of chess set ("set A").
#    In the **Preparation** section, modify the code
#    to load data with measurements from four different
#    brands of chess sets (A, B, C, and D). This data
#    is in the file `four_chess_sets.csv`. How does 
#    this affect the accuracy of the model on the test 
#    (evaluation) set?
#
# 2. In the **Specifying the model** section, modify
#    the list of feature columns to add the column that
#    specifies which brand of set each piece is from.
#    Use the following code to do this:
#    ```python
#    tf.feature_column.indicator_column(
#      tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(
#       key='set',
#       vocabulary_list=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
#      )
#    )
#    ```
#    Does the model perform better when it knows which
#    set each piece is from?
#
#    After you make this change, the code in the 
#    **Making predictions** section will fail unless
#    you also add the `set` feature to the `predict_x`
#    dictionary:
#    ```python
#    'set': ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A'],
#    ```
#
# 3. In the **TensorFlow setup** section and the
#    **Specifying the model** section, modify 
#    `BATCH_SIZE`, `TRAIN_STEPS`, the number of
#    hidden layers, and the number of nodes in the
#    hidden layers to try to improve the accuracy of
#    the model.


# ## Next steps

# Using only the three measurements of each chess piece
# (base diameter, height, and weight) as the features, 
# the model cannot as accurately and efficiently classify
# pieces drawn from multiple different brands of chess 
# sets with different dimensions and weights.

# In a real-world application, a model like this might
# need to classify pieces without knowledge of which
# brand of chess set they came from. Also, collecting
# measurements like these for every piece might be 
# impractical in a real-world application.

# An algorithm that could use _images_ of the chess
# pieces as the feature might be a more practical choice
# for classifying pieces drawn from different chess sets.
